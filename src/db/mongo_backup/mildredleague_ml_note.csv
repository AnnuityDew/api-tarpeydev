8,5fff9d0020dd182228261584,This was the beginning of a string of heartbreaks for both Samik (2nd) and Conti (3rd).,2015
9,5fff9d0020dd182228261582,2015 was a tale of two divisions. East Coast Bias finished the season with 5 teams within 1.5 games of each other. The half-game was Conti's doing. His tie with Matt in week 2 ended up being the division winner for him.,2015
10,5fff9d0020dd182228261583,"None of what happened in ECB mattered though, because the new champ would come from the West. Fonti went 11-2 in the regular season and blew out both of his playoff matchups.",2015

15,5fff9d2720dd18222826158d,"Year 5 of Mildred League gave birth to the modern divisional format, somewhat inspired by MLB (3 divisions of 5/5/4 teams). The goal was to place more emphasis on divisional rivalries and winning the division - this has largely been successful!",2017

17,5fff9d2720dd18222826158f,"Brando did the commissioner a favor and avoided tiebreaker hell by securing the only wild card spot (despite an extremely low Points For total for the season). Just behind him, FOUR other teams finished at 7-6...",2017
18,5fff9d2720dd18222826158e,"Fonti won the Champions division handily, but the other two divisions were much more competitive. Sendzik edged out the AFC East by one game, and Charles did the same in the Referees division.",2017
19,5fff9d4620dd182228261593,"The prior season revealed that the new three-division format could work, but it needed an equivalent playoff overhaul. In 2018 the playoffs were expanded to 6 teams (3 division winners and 3 wild cards) and tiebreakers were overhauled to put more emphasis on winning divisional games.",2018

22,5fff9d4620dd182228261596,The Champions and AFC East divisions had clear cut winners (Samik in particular seemed poised to finally break through with a record Points For total).,2018
23,5fff9d4620dd182228261599,"After a mostly-Washington draft, Mildred's Redskins set the record for the worst regular season performance of all time at 0-14.",2018
24,5fff9d4620dd182228261597,The playoffs were chaos (see the bracket below). The only chalk was Tarpey winning his second title. Every other matchup was a seeding upset.,2018

27,5fff9d6820dd18222826159c,"Arguably the most competitive season to date, Mildred League VII was the first to use non-traditional rosters [QB/RB/2WR/TE/2FLX/1K/1D/5B]. Moving an RB to FLX was aimed at better reflecting the modern NFL and providing teams with more flexibility in such a deep league. Shortening the bench was aimed at increasing comeback potential for teams behind in the standings (better waiver opportunities).",2019

32,5fff9da620dd1822282615a4,"On to the good stuff.
